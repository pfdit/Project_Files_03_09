	Customer Order
	In this tab, you may 
	order in new products. To do this, select a product from the drop-down menu, specify a quantity to order (under "pc(s)"), 
	and click the "Add" button. This will print 
	to the screen a text copy of what you have just ordered. The "Total: " figure
	at the bottom of the screen shows the total cost (in â‚¬) of the ordered items. Note that each product has a different 
	number of copies available. This is specified beneath "Available: ". It is not possible to order more if this number is 
	zero.
