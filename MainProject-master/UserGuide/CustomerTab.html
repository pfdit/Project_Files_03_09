	Customer
	In this tab, you may view and edit the details of your current customers. As default, you begin with
	three customers, but you may add more, or even delete these customers (if you feel like destroying business!). An ID is 
	automatically generated by the program for each customer that is in the system. This is for the program's reference, and 
	is not relevant for the user.
	To add the details of a new customer, click the "Add New" button. Once clicked, the "Edit" 
	and "Delete" options will become unclickable. The "Add New" button itself will be replaced by the "Cancel" button, which 
	may be clicked at any point to exit from the process of adding a new customer
	You will be prompted for the name, email 
	address, telephone number, and postal address of this new customer. Once the required information is inputted, click 
	"Submit" to save this new customer. Please note that all fields must be filled in. 
	Email address must be given in the 
	following format: john.doe@example.com. The local part of the email address must contain at least one alphanumeric 
	character. The domain part must contain at least one alphanumeric character before the dot, and at least two alphabetic 
	characters signifying the domain after the dot.
	Telephone numbers must be filled in according to the format 0yyxxxxxxx. 
	This covers all of the possible telephone numbers in the Republic of Ireland.
	Given the diversity of address types in this 
	country, the same checks are not (yet) in place. Therefore it is imperative for you as the user to verify yourself that 
	the address appears plausible.
	To edit the details of a current customer, select a customer from the drop-down menu, and 
	click the "Edit" button. You may then alter any of the entries according to the restrictions given above.
	To delete a 
	customer from the database, click the "Delete" button. A pop-up window will ask you whether you are sure that you wish 
	to delete that particular customer. If you are, click "Yes", and that customer's details will be removed
