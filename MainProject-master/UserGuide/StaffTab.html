	Staff
	In this tab, you may view and edit the details of your current staff. As default, you begin 
	with two members of staff, one of whom has an "Employee" access level, and the other a "Manager" access level. As in the 
	case for the Customer and Supplier tabs, an ID is generated automatically for each staff member. As previously clarified,
	this is for the program's reference, and is not relevant for the user.
	To add the details of a new staff member, click the
	"Add New" button. Once clicked, the "Edit" and "Delete" options will become unclickable. The "Add New" button itself will 
	be replaced by the "Cancel" button, which may be clicked at any point to exit from the process of adding a new supplier. 

	You will be prompted for the name, email address, contact number, postal address, and access level for this new staff 
	member. Once the required information is inputted, click "Submit" to save this new staff member. Please note that all 
	fields must be filled in. 
	Email address must be given in the following format: john.doe@example.com. The local part of the
	email address must contain at least one alphanumeric character. The domain part must contain at least one alphanumeric 
	character before the dot, and at least two alphabetic characters signifying the domain after the dot.
	Telephone numbers 
	must be filled in according to the format 0yyxxxxxxx. This covers all of the possible telephone numbers in the Republic of
	Ireland.
	Given the diversity of address types in this country, the same checks are not (yet) in place. Therefore it is 
	imperative for you as the user to verify yourself that the address appears plausible.
	The access level tells you whether 
	that particular staff member has "Employee" or "Manager" access rights. Employee access is signified by the integer "1", 
	and Manager access is signified by the integer "2". If you write a number other than 1 or 2 in this box, the program will 
	report and error, and it will be necessary to re-type the entry.
	To edit the details of a current staff member, select a 
	staff member from the drop-down menu, and click the "Edit" button. You may then alter any of the entries according to the 
	restrictions given above.
	To delete a staff member from the database, click the "Delete" button. A pop-up window will ask 
	you whether you are sure that you wish to delete that particular staff member. If you are, click "Yes", and that staff 
	member's details will be removed.
