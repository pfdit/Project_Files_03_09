	Supplier
	In this 
	tab, you may view and edit the details of your current suppliers. As default, you begin with four suppliers, but you may 
	add more, or even delete some. As in the case for the Customer tab, an ID is generated automatically for each supplier. 
	As previously clarified, this is for the program's reference, and is not relevant for the user.
	To add the details of a new 
	supplier, click the "Add New" button. Once clicked, the "Edit" and "Delete" options will become unclickable. The "Add New" 
	button itself will be replaced by the "Cancel" button, which may be clicked at any point to exit from the process of 
	adding a new supplier.
	You will be prompted for the name, email address, contact number, postal address, contact name, and 
	VAT number of this new supplier. Once the required information is inputted, click "Submit" to save this new supplier. 
	Please note that all fields must be filled in. 
	Email address must be given in the following format: john.doe@example.com. 
	The local part of the email address must contain at least one alphanumeric character. The domain part must contain at 
	least one alphanumeric character before the dot, and at least two alphabetic characters signifying the domain after the 
	dot.
	Telephone numbers must be filled in according to the format 0yyxxxxxxx. This covers all of the possible telephone 
	numbers in the Republic of Ireland.Given the diversity of address types in this country, the same checks are not (yet) in 
	place. Therefore it is imperative for you as the user to verify yourself that the address appears plausible.
	The contact 
	name should represent the name of a person with whom you have dealings in this particular supplier. It should therefore be
	a real name, and only contain alphabetic characters.
	The VAT code should be in the format xZZZZ, where x is the prefix, and
	ZZZZ are some numbers. For example, valid VAT codes would be x1234 or x5555.
	To edit the details of a current supplier, 
	select a supplier from the drop-down menu, and click the "Edit" button. You may then alter any of the entries according to
	the restrictions given above.
	To delete a supplier from the database, click the "Delete" button. A pop-up window will ask 
	you whether you are sure that you wish to delete that particular supplier. If you are, click "Yes", and that supplier's 
details will be removed.
