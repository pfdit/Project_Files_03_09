		Firstly, there are two levels of access: 
		1) Employee 
		2) Manager

		<b><u>Employee access</u></b>
		Allows only the most rudimentary of tasks, such as the ability to simply view the current customer list, 
		or to view the stock list and see how much of each product is in stock. 

		<b><u>Manager access</u></b>
		Allows access to all parts of the program. Entries may be added, edited, or even removed. So, when ordering in 
		new stock for the business, the manager may keep track of this by updating the list on this application. 
		Similarly, when a new supplier begins deliveries to the company, their details may be added to the supplier
		database.
		
		If you are a manager, and are currently logged in with an employee username, please log out by selecting the 
		"log out" command in the "user" drop-down menu bar, and then log in again using your correct details.
