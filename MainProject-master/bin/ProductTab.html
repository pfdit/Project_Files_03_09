	In this tab, you may view and edit the details of your current products. As 
	default, you have a 12 products, but you may add more, or even delete some. As in the case for the other tabs, an ID is 
	generated automatically for each supplier. As previously clarified, this is for the program's reference, and is not 
	relevant for the user.
	To add the details of a new product, click the "Add New" button. Once clicked, the "Edit" and 
	"Delete" options will become unclickable. The "Add New" button itself will be replaced by the "Cancel" button, which may 
	be clicked at any point to exit from the process of adding a new product.
	You will be prompted for the product name, 
	product category, product description, product's supplier, supplier price, retail price, profit margin wished. Once the 
	required information is inputted, click "Submit" to save this new supplier. Please note that all fields must be filled in.

	The product name field should include the make, brand, and specific model.
	The product category highlights the type of 
	product that you are adding. Example of product category include laptop or smartphone.
	The product description should 
	include any details that a customer may find useful to know. So, for example, when describing a laptop computer, it may 
	be useful to know the processor frequency, processor make, RAM, ROM, display resolution, and other noteworthy features 
	such as weight (if it is especially light), dimensions, whether or not it has a SSD, or if it comes with specific software
	already installed.
	For the product's supplier, you must select a supplier from a drop-down list. If the relevant supplier 
	is not listed here, you must return to the supplier tab and select "Add New".
	The Supplier Price shows the cost of the 
	product to you as the retail store. The Retail Price includes the markup indicated by your entry for Profit Margin.
	To edit 
	the details of a currently existing product, select a product from the drop-down menu, and click the "Edit" button. You 
	may then alter any of the entries keeping in mind the explanations given above.
	To delete a product from the database, 
	click the "Delete" button. A pop-up window will ask you whether you are sure that you wish to delete that particular 
	product. If you are, click "Yes", and all details of that product will be removed.
